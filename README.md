# Networking

#### Different Types of Network and Standards

##### Peer-based

Peer-based, also called peer to peer or simply P2P networks refers to the process of connecting two or more PCs directly to share data without the need for a separate server. P2P networks allows each connected computer to function as both server and client, as requests can be made by either machine to the other.

If computers are using a P2P connection then they will usually use the same protocols. The most common use for P2P networks is to connect computers that are in close proximity to one another, such as connecting multiple games consoles together to play a game with friends. However it is still possible to create P2P networks over a wide area. P2P networks offer alot of features that may be more complex to set up using other network configurations, such as shared storage. 

P2P networks are relativly basic compared to other network configurations and as so are quite easy to set up and use. Any computer can be connected to a P2P network as they don't require any specialist hardware. Having a P2P network for some tasks can also be faster than setting up a server as in a server based network all of the request traffic goes to one computer and this can slow the network down, however in P2P requests can go to any computer meaning the workload can be shared.

However P2P networks arn't without their flaws. The computers must be manually maintained and kept up to date, there is no central server to ensure this is the case. Ever computer must keep antivirus software up to date and this can only be done manually. If a virus was to infect a machine on a P2P network, it could spell disaster for every single machine on that network as the virus would have free access to every machine that is connected.

##### Client-Server 
Client-Server is a network configuratiuon that includes both a client and a server, this is one of the most common network configurations there is. In a Client-Server network client makes a request for date or a service from the server. For example the request could be for the clients browser to get data from a webserver because the client wants to access a website stored on that server. The server would validate the request and reply to the client with the requested websites data, then would terminate the connection.

In a Client-Server configuration all data and setting and held within the server machine, meaning that any client computer that was not authorized would not be able to access the data stored on the server machine. This can be better when storing data from multiple users as everyones data can be easily separated with each client only having access to their specific data. Furthermore, back-ups are also created and handled by the server machine meaning that the client would not have to worry about backing up the data they store on the server themselves. However this server configuration like any other does have its down side. The biggest flaw is that a server machine can be expensive to buy and to maintain, and experienced personell are usually requried to keep the server running.

##### Cloud

Cloud networking is a network configuration that connects 2 or more sub networkds via a wide are network. cloud networking can be used in many ways, such as sharing computing resources over a great distance. for example you can use the power of many computers over a cloud network to form a kind of super computer for complex math calculations.

The main appeal of cloud computing is that anyone, anywhere, can connect to a cloud network. This means that, for example, people working on a project together can all contribute to that project from separate locations. Cloud networking is not the same as cloud computing, however the two are closely related and do share alot of the same features, benifits and drawbacks.

##### Centralized

Centralized networks are a type of network in which many pc's connect to a central server that handles all of the processing power and storage on the network. All of the computers connected to the server are given processing power form the server itself. Computers that are connected to the network normally don't have much processing power on their own, just enought to connect to the network. The main benifit of this is that you can expand the network cheaply as the individual machines don't need much processing power.

##### Cluster

A cluster is a group of computers that are connected together to form a LAN, however unlike a normal network, all of the machines combine their computing power to form a single machine. The most obvious advantage to this is that it increases the complexity of the task that can be assigned to the machines, the more machines you connect, the more complex the task the cluster can complete. Also, if one machine on the network fails or shuts down, the cluster will continue to function, but at a reduced performance.

##### Virtualised

A virtualized network is a network in which the resourses are split up by dividing the networks bandwidth into multiple segments called 'channels' All of the channels act separatly from one another and can be assigned to any device on the network at any time. The main advantage of of a virtual network is that you do not need to spend money of switches or routers as they are not involved in this type of network, all connections are virtual, not physical.

#### Conceptual Models

##### TCP/IP Model


TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, it is a combination of different protocols that come together in order to connect devices over the internet. It has a total of 4 different 'layers' each with their own responsibilities and tasks.


- Application - This layer is responsible for specifying which protocol is to be used by what application or data.

- Transport - The Transport layer is responsible for creating and maintaining communication between the sender and the reciever. Only two protocols are used in this later. TCP which has a system in place to check if the recipient and recieved the data, and UDP which doenst check if the recipient has got the data.

- Internet - This layer is responsible for segmenting any data sent into packets, these packets are then routed to the recipient using the recipients IP address.

- Network Access - The Network Access layer is responsible for interfacing with your networkâ€™s architecture. It is also at this layer that error checking information is applied to sent data so the recipient can check for errors.


##### OSI Model

- Application - This layer is similar to the TCP/IP model layer of the same name, it is the layer in which different protocols are assigned to different types of data.

- Presentation - This layer is where data is compressed or encrypted. It also makes the data easier to interperate and determine the type of data it is and send it correctly.

- Session - This layer is responible for creating connections between different applications. Depending on the application and its requirements, either TCP or UDP is used, similarly to the transport layer of the TCP/IP model.

- Transport - This layer is one part of the model that is responsible for the transmision of the data. It is also the layer in which error checks are carried out on the data being sent or recieved.

- Network - This layer is the second layer that is directly involved in the sending of data, it is the layer in which the desination address and routing are taken into consideration and the appropriate information is applied to the data being sent. It also validates the address of data being recieved.

- Data Link - This layer is responsible for encrypting the data before it is sent to the recipient, it is also the same layer in which recieved data is decrypted back into readable packets for the other layers to process

- Physical - The last layer is the one that is responsible for the physical links that send the data, via cables. Information can be conveyed via electrical pulses or even light pulses.

#### Standards and Protocols

##### IEEE Standards

###### IEEE 802.3
IEEE 802.3 refers to the standart of Ethernet connections. This type of physical connection is most often used for LAN connections however can have its place in WAN set-ups. The communication standards for ethernet connections and cables are updated regularly adding aditional features however 802.3 was the first IEEE standard to be implemented. The description of this standard stated that these connections must be at speeds of 10Mbits/s which is equal to 1.25MB/s.

###### IEEE 802.7
IEEE 802.7 is the standards assigned to broadband connections, what is outlined here is thes design and implementation of the connection. It also outlines some methods of testing the connections that should also be followed.

###### IEEE 802.8
IEEE 802.8 refers to the standard of fibre optic connections. It is in the same group as the previous standards and outlines many of the same defining features however is called a standard by itself as it covers a different connection type.

###### IEEE 802.11
IEEE 802.11 refers to the standard of wireless conectivity. The most common connection to follow these standards by far is Wi-Fi, this standard outlines what frequencies are to be used via wireless access points and hubs.

---------------------------

#### Routed Protocols

Routed Protocol is a blanket term that is used to describe the different protocols that govern how data is routed from one machine to another. However this term is not often used in practice because the only protocol left in this catagory is IPv4 and IPv6. Other protocols in this catagory encounterd issues at some point during their lifespan that they could not overcome. However this is not to say that IPv4 has not encounterd problems as it has. Its main problem was that it began to run out of addresses it could assign to machines. This is because so many machines were being built that the 4 Billion possible addresses that IPv4 has started to run out. To solve this issue, IPv6 was designed. The principles are the same as IPv4 however the number of possible addresses was drastically increased to over 340 undecillion (2^128).

#### Services and Network Applications

##### HTTP
HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and is used for the purposes of sending data about websites. HTTP covers everything to do with interperating what the user wants and recieving the data from the web server on what should be displayed on the webpage.

##### FTP
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is a standard internet protocol for sending and recieving files. FTP relies on a two way connection between a user and a FTP server. FTP allowed the user to upload, edit and dowload files from the server.

##### SSL
SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It is designed to ensure that sesntitive data is sent securely by encrypting it. It is used when entering and sending data such as credit card information or finatial documentation such as tax forms.

##### SMTP
SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, it is the protocol that is used to send and recieve emails. most modern email services use this protocol.

##### POP3
POP stands for Post Office Protocol. It is a protocol that changes how a user recieves emails. In the most recent version called POP3, the clients email is stored on a server which is then downloaded by the user. after which it can be deleted.

#### The Impact of Networking Topology, Communication and Bandwidth

##### Topologies
Topolgies are the rules by which different networks are designed. Each topology is designed to fill a different role and all have their strenghts and weaknesess. The term 'physical topology' details the design of LANs, using various different cables and connectors to create the layout of the network. Some examples of physical topologies are as follows:

- The star topology is the idea of all of the machines being connected to a single hub or switch at the center of the network, with the various connections comming out of this center hub or switch like a star.

- The mesh topology is the idea of multiple connections between different machines on the network allowing for different routes to be used if one becomes inoperable.

- The bus topology is a simple design, all of the network components are connected in a line.

- The ring topology is the idea of all of the components of the network being aranged into a circle formation. ~Each unit is connected to the two units next to it.

##### Communication
Communication is the process of two or more machines sending and recieving data from one another via a network. The most common form of communication between computers is the act of requesting data from a server. This can range frome requesting web data from a web server to requesting access to your emails from an email server. While connected to the internet, data is being sent to and from your device at all times. In a network it is the router that directs web traffic and data to where it needs to go. Because data is always being send or recieved, there is a constant risk of an attack being launched while the data is in transit or sent with the data itself. For this reason, security measures like firewall are used on most machines connected to the internet in order to help keep the user safe and secure by blocking certain types of data by closing different ports not in use. Due to these security measures, the speed of data transfer can often be reduced as it takes time to carry out these security checks. In some cases the data may not reach its intended recipient at all as the security features and falsly flagged the data as a threat. While this situation is rare it can happen.
