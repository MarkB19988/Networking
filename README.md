# Networking

#### Different Types of Network and Standards

##### Peer-based

Peer-based, also called peer to peer or simply P2P networks refers to the process of connecting two or more PCs directly to share data without the need for a separate server. P2P networks allows each connected computer to function as both server and client, as requests can be made by either machine to the other.

If computers are using a P2P connection then they will usually use the same protocols. The most common use for P2P networks is to connect computers that are in close proximity to one another, such as connecting multiple games consoles together to play a game with friends. However it is still possible to create P2P networks over a wide area. P2P networks offer alot of features that may be more complex to set up using other network configurations, such as shared storage. 

P2P networks are relativly basic compared to other network configurations and as so are quite easy to set up and use. Any computer can be connected to a P2P network as they don't require any specialist hardware. Having a P2P network for some tasks can also be faster than setting up a server as in a server based network all of the request traffic goes to one computer and this can slow the network down, however in P2P requests can go to any computer meaning the workload can be shared.

However P2P networks arn't without their flaws. The computers must be manually maintained and kept up to date, there is no central server to ensure this is the case. Ever computer must keep antivirus software up to date and this can only be done manually. If a virus was to infect a machine on a P2P network, it could spell disaster for every single machine on that network as the virus would have free access to every machine that is connected.

##### Client-Server 
Client-Server is a network configuratiuon that includes both a client and a server, this is one of the most common network configurations there is. In a Client-Server network client makes a request for date or a service from the server. For example the request could be for the clients browser to get data from a webserver because the client wants to access a website stored on that server. The server would validate the request and reply to the client with the requested websites data, then would terminate the connection.

In a Client-Server configuration all data and setting and held within the server machine, meaning that any client computer that was not authorized would not be able to access the data stored on the server machine. This can be better when storing data from multiple users as everyones data can be easily separated with each client only having access to their specific data. Furthermore, back-ups are also created and handled by the server machine meaning that the client would not have to worry about backing up the data they store on the server themselves. However this server configuration like any other does have its down side. The biggest flaw is that a server machine can be expensive to buy and to maintain, and experienced personell are usually requried to keep the server running.

##### Cloud

Cloud networking is a network configuration that connects 2 or more sub networkds via a wide are network. cloud networking can be used in many ways, such as sharing computing resources over a great distance. for example you can use the power of many computers over a cloud network to form a kind of super computer for complex math calculations.

The main appeal of cloud computing is that anyone, anywhere, can connect to a cloud network. This means that, for example, people working on a project together can all contribute to that project from separate locations. Cloud networking is not the same as cloud computing, however the two are closely related and do share alot of the same features, benifits and drawbacks.

##### Centralized

Centralized networks are a type of network in which many pc's connect to a central server that handles all of the processing power and storage on the network. All of the computers connected to the server are given processing power form the server itself. Computers that are connected to the network normally don't have much processing power on their own, just enought to connect to the network. The main benifit of this is that you can expand the network cheaply as the individual machines don't need much processing power.

##### Cluster

A cluster is a group of computers that are connected together to form a LAN, however unlike a normal network, all of the machines combine their computing power to form a single machine. The most obvious advantage to this is that it increases the complexity of the task that can be assigned to the machines, the more machines you connect, the more complex the task the cluster can complete. Also, if one machine on the network fails or shuts down, the cluster will continue to function, but at a reduced performance.

##### Virtualised

A virtualized network is a network in which the resourses are split up by dividing the networks bandwidth into multiple segments called 'channels' All of the channels act separatly from one another and can be assigned to any device on the network at any time. The main advantage of of a virtual network is that you do not need to spend money of switches or routers as they are not involved in this type of network, all connections are virtual, not physical.

---------------------------

#### Conceptual Models

##### TCP/IP Model


TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, it is a combination of different protocols that come together in order to connect devices over the internet. It has a total of 4 different 'layers' each with their own responsibilities and tasks.


- Application - This layer is responsible for specifying which protocol is to be used by what application or data.

- Transport - The Transport layer is responsible for creating and maintaining communication between the sender and the reciever. Only two protocols are used in this later. TCP which has a system in place to check if the recipient and recieved the data, and UDP which doenst check if the recipient has got the data.

- Internet - This layer is responsible for segmenting any data sent into packets, these packets are then routed to the recipient using the recipients IP address.

- Network Access - The Network Access layer is responsible for interfacing with your networkâ€™s architecture. It is also at this layer that error checking information is applied to sent data so the recipient can check for errors.


##### OSI Model

- Application - This layer is similar to the TCP/IP model layer of the same name, it is the layer in which different protocols are assigned to different types of data.

- Presentation - This layer is where data is compressed or encrypted. It also makes the data easier to interperate and determine the type of data it is and send it correctly.

- Session - This layer is responible for creating connections between different applications. Depending on the application and its requirements, either TCP or UDP is used, similarly to the transport layer of the TCP/IP model.

- Transport - This layer is one part of the model that is responsible for the transmision of the data. It is also the layer in which error checks are carried out on the data being sent or recieved.

- Network - This layer is the second layer that is directly involved in the sending of data, it is the layer in which the desination address and routing are taken into consideration and the appropriate information is applied to the data being sent. It also validates the address of data being recieved.

- Data Link - This layer is responsible for encrypting the data before it is sent to the recipient, it is also the same layer in which recieved data is decrypted back into readable packets for the other layers to process

- Physical - The last layer is the one that is responsible for the physical links that send the data, via cables. Information can be conveyed via electrical pulses or even light pulses.

#### Standards and Protocols

##### IEEE Standards

###### IEEE 802.3
IEEE 802.3 refers to the standart of Ethernet connections. This type of physical connection is most often used for LAN connections however can have its place in WAN set-ups. The communication standards for ethernet connections and cables are updated regularly adding aditional features however 802.3 was the first IEEE standard to be implemented. The description of this standard stated that these connections must be at speeds of 10Mbits/s which is equal to 1.25MB/s.

###### IEEE 802.7
IEEE 802.7 is the standards assigned to broadband connections, what is outlined here is thes design and implementation of the connection. It also outlines some methods of testing the connections that should also be followed.

###### IEEE 802.8
IEEE 802.8 refers to the standard of fibre optic connections. It is in the same group as the previous standards and outlines many of the same defining features however is called a standard by itself as it covers a different connection type.

###### IEEE 802.11
IEEE 802.11 refers to the standard of wireless conectivity. The most common connection to follow these standards by far is Wi-Fi, this standard outlines what frequencies are to be used via wireless access points and hubs.

---------------------------

#### Routed Protocols

Routed Protocol is a blanket term that is used to describe the different protocols that govern how data is routed from one machine to another. However this term is not often used in practice because the only protocol left in this catagory is IPv4 and IPv6. Other protocols in this catagory encounterd issues at some point during their lifespan that they could not overcome. However this is not to say that IPv4 has not encounterd problems as it has. Its main problem was that it began to run out of addresses it could assign to machines. This is because so many machines were being built that the 4 Billion possible addresses that IPv4 has started to run out. To solve this issue, IPv6 was designed. The principles are the same as IPv4 however the number of possible addresses was drastically increased to over 340 undecillion (2^128).

#### Services and Network Applications

##### HTTP
HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and is used for the purposes of sending data about websites. HTTP covers everything to do with interperating what the user wants and recieving the data from the web server on what should be displayed on the webpage.

##### FTP
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It is a standard internet protocol for sending and recieving files. FTP relies on a two way connection between a user and a FTP server. FTP allowed the user to upload, edit and dowload files from the server.

##### SSL
SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer. It is designed to ensure that sesntitive data is sent securely by encrypting it. It is used when entering and sending data such as credit card information or finatial documentation such as tax forms.

##### SMTP
SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, it is the protocol that is used to send and recieve emails. most modern email services use this protocol.

##### POP3
POP stands for Post Office Protocol. It is a protocol that changes how a user recieves emails. In the most recent version called POP3, the clients email is stored on a server which is then downloaded by the user. after which it can be deleted.

#### The Impact of Networking Topology, Communication and Bandwidth

##### Topologies
Logical Topologies are concepts, defining the architecture of the communication of the nodes in a network. The topology of a network can be dynamically maintained and reconfigured by routers and switches. The topology is mainly defining how the signals act on the network media or how data passes through the network to the devices.

Ethernet is based on a type of logical topology known as the bus topology, which is a common logical solution defines the physical topologies, laying out the logics of the data travelling to all devices from one device in a network.

The physical topology refers to the actual structure of a LAN, utilising various networking cables to connect the physical devices on the network. It allows for organization of the network, by physically laying it out. It takes a lot of planning by determining the cable to be used and how they it runs through the building.

Several types of physical topologies:

The star physical topology is a physical network that has the nodes connected to a centralized point, which can be a hub or switch.
A mesh network is much different, where the various parts can connect via multiple hops and can allow for rerouting on a different path if the current one is broken.
A bus topology is a lenient network, with the nodes all in a straight line and are terminated on both ends.
A ring network is where the nodes create a circular path, each device joined to two others and the data packets travel around these nodes until it reaches its destination.
The main difference of physical and logical topologies is that logical is a visual representation of the network, showcasing how it could work, whereas the physical topology is actually physical; joined together with cables and switches.

Communication
Communication is the transmission of data from either a computer or a device to another over a computer network, where said network is considered a telecommunications network that allows for the transmission of data. Essentially most common processes when browsing the internet has data transmission happening between the user and the server, such as retrieving a file from the internet or sending off an email, so with internet use, data is being communicated between servers, routers and other clients each time. However, to use the internet, the user would have to connect to the internet. A device is used to connect to a network, being a modem or router, which communicates with the internet; requesting permission to have the user join, to which data is sent back enabling the connection.

Data is being communicated each time, but the data flow is also prone to attacks and malicious attempts to gain information from other users. Security measures such as firewalls within a network that can limit down the communications rate and to ensure that no malicious attacks can happen. With security measures, no malicious data can travel to unsuspecting users or end up within the network.

Within a network model, the communication of data happens within layers. The TCP/IP has an applications layer that allows for services to be requested from the user to the application, meaning that data is ready to be sent, but namely focuses in the transport and internet layer, where the transport handles the communication between the hosts and for successful delivery and the internet layer sends the data across to the correct host. These layers aid the communication of data successfully by monitoring the data transfer and communicating with the right host. All communication channels within any networking model have limited frequency bandwidth, which are down to the properties of the channel or for more practical reasons, such as to prevent any interference from other sources. Because of this, bandwidth cannot be maximized to its full potential and can cause problems, with the most obvious being that any low bandwidth can reduce speed in both browsing the internet and downloading files, making the bandwidth speed a huge bottleneck.
