# Networking

#### Different Types of Network and Standards

##### Peer-based

Peer-based, also called peer to peer or simply P2P networks refers to the process of connecting two or more PCs directly to share data without the need for a separate server. P2P networks allows each connected computer to function as both server and client, as requests can be made by either machine to the other.

If computers are using a P2P connection then they will usually use the same protocols. The most common use for P2P networks is to connect computers that are in close proximity to one another, such as connecting multiple games consoles together to play a game with friends. However it is still possible to create P2P networks over a wide area. P2P networks offer alot of features that may be more complex to set up using other network configurations, such as shared storage. 

P2P networks are relativly basic compared to other network configurations and as so are quite easy to set up and use. Any computer can be connected to a P2P network as they don't require any specialist hardware. Having a P2P network for some tasks can also be faster than setting up a server as in a server based network all of the request traffic goes to one computer and this can slow the network down, however in P2P requests can go to any computer meaning the workload can be shared.

However P2P networks arn't without their flaws. The computers must be manually maintained and kept up to date, there is no central server to ensure this is the case. Ever computer must keep antivirus software up to date and this can only be done manually. If a virus was to infect a machine on a P2P network, it could spell disaster for every single machine on that network as the virus would have free access to every machine that is connected.

##### Client-Server 
Client-Server is a network configuratiuon that includes both a client and a server, this is one of the most common network configurations there is. In a Client-Server network client makes a request for date or a service from the server. For example the request could be for the clients browser to get data from a webserver because the client wants to access a website stored on that server. The server would validate the request and reply to the client with the requested websites data, then would terminate the connection.

In a Client-Server configuration all data and setting and held within the server machine, meaning that any client computer that was not authorized would not be able to access the data stored on the server machine. This can be better when storing data from multiple users as everyones data can be easily separated with each client only having access to their specific data. Furthermore, back-ups are also created and handled by the server machine meaning that the client would not have to worry about backing up the data they store on the server themselves.

Howeer this server configuration like any other does have its down side. The biggest flaw is that a server machine can be expensive to buy and to maintain, and experienced personell are usually requried to keep the server running.

##### Cloud

Cloud networking is a network configuration that connects 2 or more sub networkds via a Cloud networking uses cloud computing, where centralized computing resources are shared amongst clients, but the network is also shared as well. It works the same way as standard networking but it’s component, devices and operations are all in the cloud.

The main benefit of cloud computing is that you can connect anywhere at any time regardless of device or place. A user can connect via a router that goes directly to the cloud server, so the user is not bound to a room. Cloud networking shares its characteristics with cloud computing, meaning that the benefits of cloud computing are also present with networking. For instance, you can access, edit and share documents at any time with people who are also connected to the network, allowing for good teamwork workflow without having to be in the same office.

Cluster
A computer cluster consists of a single unit made up of multiple computers linked through a LAN and the joint computers act as if they were a single powerful machine. They have a node set to each cluster to perform the same task, so that they can perform that task at a faster rate with a higher joint processing speed.

The obvious benefit that Cluster networking offers is the processing speed, where the computers working together provide unified processing, producing the fastest amount overall. If a single component in the cluster fails, other computers can continue to provide the processing, backing up the failed component. The computer cluster is made up of different LAN topologies and these networks create a highly efficient and effective mainframe that prevents any bottlenecking.

Centralized
Centralized networking is a form of networking where users connect to a central server and this server manages all of the computing resources, administration and user management. The server in turn delivers application logic, processing and the computer resources to the connected users. Each machine involved in this network generally are considered “thin clients”, computers with a display, basic input devices and a thin CPU with networking capabilities, so the main server provides the client with computing resources and other high-end faciliites.

In regards to the benefits of this type of networking, it helps in reducing cost as the main server mainly has the high-end output; it doesn’t emphasize on hardware and the client PCs, so any thin client can be used with it.

Virtualised
A virtualized network is a method of combining the available network resources by splitting up the bandwidth into channels. Each channel is independent from the others and can be assigned to a server or device in real time. All users have access to the resources from the network from one computer.

A virtualized network is virtual; nothing physical is used with this type of networking and makes it more cost effective, with no need to utilize and maintain, physical switches, routers or servers. In case of a failure or a disaster, the virtualized network gets applications and systems up faster and even such outages can be prevented.
